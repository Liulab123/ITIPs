Identification TE insertions  polymorphisms based on a pan-genome and large-scale resequencing data

Step 1ï¼š identification of reference insertions and deletions




Step 2: Determination of TE insertions polymorphisms (TIPs)





Step 3: Genotype TIPs in a large-scale B. rapa resequencing genome using short reads
